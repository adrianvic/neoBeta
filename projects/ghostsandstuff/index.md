This plugins was made to use stuff from my library that would not fit into any plugin (or not in the way presented here) that has ~~a lot~~ (WIP) of random stuff. Everything should be togglable in the config.

## Features
- **RainbowChat:** Rainbow color code.
- **SkibidiBlocker:** Strike a lightning on players that say a word.
- **AntiSpam:** Blocks repeated words in the chat. Optionally can strike a lightning to the player who is spamming.

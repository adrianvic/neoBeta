## Description
This mod is made to replicate the HUD given to you by the console version of the game. It shifts the hotbar upwards and reorients the way lighting is shown on the blocks to make it better match. The controls are not displayed on the bottom, nor are any other interface elements tweaked. This mod does not allow you to play with a controller, for that I recommend using AntiMicro.

## Custom commands with predefined responses!
This plugin adds a simple way to add custom commands that will respond users with predefined messages from config.yml. It supports Minecraft's color coding (use & instead of §) and placeholders for player/server info (TODO).

### Default Commands
 - About
 - Aboukkit
These default commands §aneed§r to be configured.

### Adding new commands
First of all: run the server with the plugin for the first time, so config.yml is generated.

Follow the structure that the template shows in your config.yml. Then use a file explorer to open the plugin's JAR file and edit plugin.yml, you can copy a command entry and fill all the fields (be careful with indentation, YML does not support TAB).

### Why?
I made this plugin because I have a server for version b1.7.3 and I wanted to add a /about command to give credit to the server founders and link to our website. So I made this that I will use every time I need a simple 'wall of text' command.

Newer versions
I don't see why I would build this for latest versions, I guess there are already better solutions. I made this just because of the lack of plugins for Minecraft beta.

This is a dependency for my other projects. This does not do anything on it's own.

## Why do I have to install this alongside your plugins?

You may think that installing two plugins instead of one is installing unecessary bloat that is useless. But it's not, libraries hold code that is common to more than one project, so you avoid having the same code repeated twice or more in your server. Also it's easier for the developer that has to improve only a single codebase to improve all the rest of the dependants.
